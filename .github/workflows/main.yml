# This is a basic workflow to build robot code.

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events for main and develop branches
on:
  push:
    branches: 
      - main 
      - develop 
      - 'release/**'
  pull_request:
    branches: 
      - main 
      - develop 

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # This grabs the WPILib docker container
    container: wpilib/roborio-cross-ubuntu:2022-18.04

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Runs a single command using the runners shell
    - name: Compile and run tests on robot code
      run: ./gradlew build

    # Runs a simulation to spot check crashes
    - name: Run simulation to check for runtime errors
      run: timeout 1m ./gradlew simulateJava 2>&1 | awk -v rc=0 '/The robot program quit unexpectedly/ { rc=1 } 1; END {exit rc}'
      # 1. Run simulation with 1 minute timeout
      # 2. Redirect stderr to stdout (just in case)
      # 3. Use awk to check for robot crash message and set the return code based on this. (Alternative to grep that doesn't filter the simulation output)
